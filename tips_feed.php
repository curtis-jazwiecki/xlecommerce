  &lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

   &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realtree.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://67.227.172.78/images/logo/realtree_new.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;336px&quot; height=&quot;95&quot; &gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/td&gt;

 &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

 &lt;td&gt;

  &lt;b&gt;Horsing Around&lt;/b&gt;

  &lt;br/&gt;

  &lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;A friend of mind went to a seminar where part of the socializing involved a horseback trail ride and a cookout. He was a very occasional horse rider, usually as part of his annual elk hunts. His comment immediately after the seminar was &quot;Thank goodness I wasn't on an elk hunt. After that trail ride I was so sore that I could barely get around for two days.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every elk outfitter or guide in the business who uses horses can tell you dozens of similar stories. Every year, many hopeful elk hunters see their hunts diminished or ruined by becoming saddle sore.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Horseback riding stresses muscles and abrades body parts that everyday life seldom challenges. If your elk hunt will involve horses, go to a local stable and tune up your riding skills beforehand. It's all part of being in shape for the season.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A tip: Wearing pantyhose or Lycra exercise pants under your hunting pants really cuts down the wear and tear on your backside.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

 &lt;td&gt;

  &lt;b&gt;The Secondary Rut&lt;/b&gt;

  &lt;br/&gt;

  &lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;If you don't tag out during the primary rut, you have a second chance. The secondary rut occurs about 28 days after the primary rut is over.&lt;br/&gt;Any adult doe not successfully bred during the primary rut will come into heat again on the 28th day of her estrus cycle. In addition, early-born doe fawns often come into their first heat at this time.&lt;br/&gt;Be watchful for the signs of the secondary rut. You'll find rubs that are newly touched up and both new scrapes and older ones that have been freshened up. The bucks are more than happy to take advantage of another breeding opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;Use the same rut-hunting tactics as are recommended for the primary rut. These include grunting and doe bleats and hunting heavy cover near doe concentration areas. However, you should hunt more cautiously and be a bit more subtle with your calls. The secondary rut is not as intense as the primary and the bucks are wise to hunting pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

 &lt;td&gt;

  &lt;b&gt;Duck Soup&lt;/b&gt;

  &lt;br/&gt;

  &lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;I like to cook wild game. There's something about a well-roasted duck on a bed of wild rice with all the trimmings that satisfies both my creative and gastric urges. There are a host of good recipes in game cookbooks but if you are going to roast the traditional way, it is better to pluck the bird.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skinned birds need considerable larding and basting to stay moist in the oven or on the grill. A very simple and tasty way to cook duck is to fillet out the breast meat and separate it into its four natural parts, then tenderize (pound), season and pan fry just as you would a steak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With some of the stronger tasting waterfowl, such as snow geese, fillet out the meat, mix with equal parts pork, grind and apply your favorite smoked sausage recipe. You will be amazed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There's not much munching on a duck leg. However, save the legs of several birds and crockpot them for some fine morsels of good eating.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

 &lt;td&gt;

  &lt;b&gt;The Duck Hunter's Coat&lt;/b&gt;

  &lt;br/&gt;

  &lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Like much waterfowling gear, the duck hunter's clothing choices have widened and been improved. Regardless of other gear, a true duck hunting coat is a necessity. Gone are the days when a duck coat had to be heavy and stiff as a poker to withstand the weather and rigors of waterfowling.&lt;br/&gt;A good duck coat should be in camouflage, waterproof and hopefully comfortable. Today there are a number of excellent models that fill this basic bill. The use of several high-tech synthetic fabrics, waterproof but breathable membranes and ever lighter insulation have achieved high performance and greater comfort with no loss of functionality or durability.&lt;br/&gt;I prefer my duck coat to have a removable hood and a storm flap to protect the throat. There should be lots of pockets, inside and out, including handwarmer pockets. The outside pockets should have grommets to let water drain out.&lt;br/&gt;A really sturdy zipper with a tab large enough to be gripped with gloved hands or cold, numb fingers is the finishing touch.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;

 &lt;td&gt;

  &lt;b&gt;Patterning vs. Scouting&lt;/b&gt;

  &lt;br/&gt;

  &lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Scouting refers to learning the lay of your deer hunting land, including key terrain features that affect deer movement and those that might give you a hunting advantage. It also means learning the general habits of the overall deer herd.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patterning is getting to know a particular buck very well, learning his habits and hangouts. This is risky work. When you focus on a particular buck, he can very easily also focus on you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deal with him from a distance. In open and woodlot country, binoculars are a very handy tool. Learn his trails and his sign but make every effort not to be intrusive nor let him feel your presence or pressure. In particular stay away from his bedding areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If, by accident, you bump into the buck while patterning him, back off and leave him alone for awhile for his suspicion to go away. Too many accidental contacts before you are ready to hunt him will make your job very difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
