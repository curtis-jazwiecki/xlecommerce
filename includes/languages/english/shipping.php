Please submit your price matching requests via email to <a href="mailto:STORE EMAIL">STORE EMAIL</a>. Please be sure   to include a link to the competing web site or the print ad out of a current   magazine. After we verify the product and its price we will contact you. Please   consider we will only match legitimate dealers advertised pricing on current   products (this does not include closeout, blemished, auctions, ect). We reserve   the right to match prices only at our discretion, please bear in mind we may not   be able to match every price, but we will do our best.</p>
<p><strong><em>Out of Stocks and Backorders</em></strong></p>
<p>We try our best to have everything in our online catalog   available 100% of the time; however we do run out of some items from time to   time. If an item you order is out of stock, you will be notified within one   business day of your order. Items are considered out of stock if they can not   ship within three days. It is your choice to either cancel the order before we   fully process it and nothing will be charged to you, or you may choose to   backorder the item.<br />
</p>
<p>To place a backorder simply email us at <a href="mailto:STORE EMAIL">STORE EMAIL</a>.   Backorders are charged 100% up front and shipped immediately upon receiving the   item in stock. You may cancel the backorder at any time; however you will be   charged a 20% backorder cancellation fee. We do not always have a reliable ETA   on backorders. Understand that we are at the mercy of the manufacturer to   actually get more products to us, and we always do our best to get the products   to you in a timely manner. </p>
<p>We may have other equivalent products available that are not   listed on the website due to continually changing product lines. You may call or   email and we will always do our best to help find you what you need.</p>
<p><em><strong>Shipping Fees </strong></em></p>

We reserve the   right to use any shipping provider for these orders. Shipping price listed   online is not applicable on some oversize items and international orders, in   these cases actual shipping via the lowest cost carrier will be charged. </p>
<p><em><strong>Low Order Fee</strong></em></p>
<p>Some orders under 50.00 may be subject to an 8.00 handling fee.   The handling fee will only be charged if the order is being drop shipped and the   warehouse requires a drop shipment fee. It will be automatically added when your   card is processed.</p>
