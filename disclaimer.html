      <TD><p class="style1">There are absolutely <STRONG>NO</STRONG> <STRONG>RETURNS</STRONG> on loaded ammunition, powder, or   primers. This is due to liability and insurance issues beyond our control.   Please make sure you are buying exactly what you need. If you have any questions   at all, check with one of our trained staff.&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="style1">Effective with all firearms sales after February   7th, 2005 federal and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and   Explosives (BATFE) rules and regulations for the control and monitoring of   firearms and transactions are extensive. Effective with all firearms sold after   January 10th, 2005, we will charge a   $15.00 fee on all firearms returned. This is to cover our cost for re-processing   and re-logging under these new BATF regulations. Only UNFIRED, new in the box   firearms may be returned. All manuals, warranty cards, locks, chokes etc. must   be in the box with the firearm. All other return policies apply to returned   firearms.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="style1">We follow all Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,   Firearms, and Explosives (BATFE) rules and regulations for the sale and transfer   of firearms. The purchaser of the firearm(s) must be present to fill out all   paperwork. If the purchaser does not reside within a reasonable driving distance   of our location we will transfer the firearm(s) to a valid Federal Firearms   License (FFL) holder closer to their residence per BATFE regulations.   Firearm(s), shipping costs, and transfer fees must be paid in full before the   transfer takes place. It is the purchaser&rsquo;s responsibility to notify us of whom the receiving FFL holder is, both this shop and the receiving FFL holder involved must be notified, and FFL&rsquo;s   must be exchanged before the firearm(s) is transferred. The purchaser is   responsible for any fees the receiving FFL holder requests and the BATFE form   4473 must be filled out when the firearm(s) is picked up at the receiving FFL   holder. When transferring a firearm the receiving FFL holder is required to   follow the regulations for the state the purchaser resides in. If we are aware that your state does not allow the sale of the gun you   want, we WILL NOT ship it to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="style1">It is the purchaser&rsquo;s responsibility to know the   regulations of the state, county, and city they reside in. We are not currently   shipping firearms to the state of California.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="style1">All firearms sales conducted through our website   are final. If there is any problem with a firearm transferred to us from another FFL holder reparations are the responsibilities of the   original FFL holder not this shop.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="style1">Conversely when we do   accept transfers from other FFL holders, all the above regulations   apply.</p></TD>
